        My mum still can't explain what I do, so let me try: I’ve had the privilege of creating design systems, leading teams, and building products. I solve problems by balancing design, technology, and business needs. When I'm not binge-watching TV series or playing Dota 2, I'm diving into the latest tools and technologies that have shaped me as a developer.

      <p className="text-lg dark:text-gray-300 tracking-wide text-gray-800 mb-4">
        I have a beautiful German Shepherd named Bailey and a passion for purpose-driven design. I craft robust, scalable architecture focused on long-term growth. My expertise spans both frontend and backend development, where I prioritize clean, maintainable code and integrate tools that enhance productivity and value.

      <p className="text-lg dark:text-gray-300 tracking-wide text-gray-800 mb-4">
        With a critical eye and analytical mindset, I balance innovation with practicality, rigorously testing new ideas to ensure they meet high standards for quality and performance. Whether it's building APIs, designing headless frontends, or creating flexible backends, I strive to deliver solutions that are both powerful and resilient.
