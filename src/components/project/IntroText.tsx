        My mum still can't explain what I do, so let me try: I’ve had the
        privilege of creating design systems, leading teams, and building
        products. I solve problems by balancing design, technology, and business
        needs. When I'm not binge-watching TV series or playing{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">Dota 2</span>, I'm diving into the latest
        tools and technologies that have shaped me as a developer.

        I have a beautiful German Shepherd named{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">Bailey</span> and a passion for
        purpose-driven design. I craft robust, scalable architecture focused on
        long-term growth. My expertise spans both frontend and backend
        development, where I prioritize clean, maintainable code and integrate
        tools that enhance productivity and value.

      <p className="mb-4 font-light">
        With a critical eye and analytical mindset, I balance innovation with
        practicality, rigorously testing new ideas to ensure they meet high
        standards for quality and performance. Whether it's building APIs,
        designing headless frontends, or creating flexible backends, I strive to
        deliver solutions that are both powerful and resilient.
