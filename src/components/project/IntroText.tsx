        My mum still can't explain what I do, so let me try: I’ve had the
        privilege of creating design systems, leading teams, and building

        I craft robust, scalable architecture focused on long-term growth. My
        expertise spans both frontend and backend development, where I
        prioritize clean, maintainable code and integrate tools that enhance
        productivity and value.

        With a critical eye and analytical mindset, I balance innovation with
        practicality, rigorously testing new ideas to ensure they meet high
        standards for quality and performance. Whether it's building APIs,
        designing headless frontends, or creating flexible backends, I strive to
        deliver solutions that are both powerful and resilient.
